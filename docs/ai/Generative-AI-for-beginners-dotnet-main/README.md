Welcome to **Generative AI for Beginners .NET**, the hands-on course for .NET developers diving into the world of Generative AI!

This isn‚Äôt your typical ‚Äúhere‚Äôs some theory, good luck‚Äù course. This repository is all about **real-world applications** and **live coding** to empower .NET developers to take full advantage of Generative AI.

This is **hands-on**, **practical**, and designed to be **fun**!

Don't forget to [star (üåü) this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) to find it easier later. 

‚û°Ô∏èGet your own copy by [Forking this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/Generative-AI-for-beginners-dotnet/fork) and find it next in your own repositories.

## ‚ú® What's New!

We're constantly improving this course with the latest AI tools and models:

- **MCP Library Integration**: We've integrated the [Model Context Protocol C# SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk) to provide a standardized way to communicate with AI models across different providers. This allows for more consistent model interactions while reducing provider lock-in. Check our samples in the Core Techniques section!
  - [5 min video overview of an Aspire + MCP demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2holzbob1_I)
  - Sample code for the video in the [04-PracticalSamples/src/Aspire.MCP.Sample.sln](./04-PracticalSamples/src/Aspire.MCP.Sample.sln) solution.

## üöÄ Introduction

Generative AI is transforming software development, and .NET is no exception. This course aims to simplify the journey by offering:

- Short 5-10 minute videos for each lesson.
- Fully functional .NET code samples you can run and explore.
- Integration with tools like **GitHub Codespaces** and **GitHub Models** for seamless setup and fast time-to-code. But if you want to run the samples locally with your own models, you can totally do that too.

You'll learn how to implement Generative AI into .NET projects, from basic text generation to building full-fledged solutions using **GitHub Models**, **Azure OpenAI Services** and **local models with Ollama**.

## üì¶ Each Lesson Includes

- **Short Video**: A quick overview of the lesson (5-10 minutes).
- **Complete Code Samples**: Fully functional and ready to run.
- **Step-by-Step Guidance**: Simple instructions to help you learn and implement the concepts.
- **Deep Dive References**: This course focuses on the practical implementation of GenAI, to get deeper into the theoretical we also provide links to explanations in [Generative AI for Beginners - A Course](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners) when needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è What You Need

To get started, you'll need:

1. A **GitHub account** (free is fine!) to [fork this entire repo](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners-dotnet/fork) to your own GitHub account.

1. **GitHub Codespaces enabled** for instant coding environments. You can enable GitHub Codespaces in your repository settings. Learn more about GitHub Codespaces [here](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces).

1. Create your copy by [Forking this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/Generative-AI-for-beginners-dotnet/fork), or use the `Fork` button at the top of this page.

1. A basic understanding of **.NET development**. Learn more about .NET [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet).

And that's it.

We've designed this course to be as low-friction as possible. We make use of the following to help you get started quickly:

- **Run in GitHub Codespaces**: With one click, you'll get a pre-configured environment to test and explore the lessons.
- **Leverage GitHub Models**: Try out AI-powered demos hosted directly within this repo, we explain more in the lessons, as we go. *(If you want to learn more about GitHub Models, click [here](https://docs.github.com/github-models))*

Then when you're ready to expand we also have guides for:

- Upgrading to **Azure OpenAI Services** for scalable and enterprise-ready solutions.
- Using **Ollama** to run models locally on your hardware for enhanced privacy and control.
